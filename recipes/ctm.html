        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chicken tikka masala is likely the most known Indian dish in most western countries, it also happens to be a personal favorite of mine. The beautiful color, depth of flavor, and general approachability has allowed this dish to wanderinto the hearts and bellies of people who may have never otherwise chosen to indulge in Indian cuisine. </p>
        <p>While I may call this a recipe, it is more of a loose guideline to making a dish that is directly inspired by the chicken tikka masala at my favorite local Indian restaurant. It will be easy to end up with a dish that can't be honestly described as chicken tikka masala with my approach, but it usually ends up tasting good enough that I generally do not mind.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Heavy Cream, optional</li>
            <li>Plain Yogurt, unstrained</li>
            <li>Ghee, you can use most cooking oils though</li>
            <li>Garam Masala, off the shelf is fine to learn with</li>
            <li>Cardamom Pods</li>
            <li>Cumin</li>
            <li>Tumeric</li>
            <li>Kashmiri Chili Peppers, ground</li>
            <li>Freshly Chopped Garlic, take the time to chop/press your garlic</li>
            <li>Freshly Grated Ginger</li>
            <li>Tomato Paste</li>
            <li>Crushed Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Onions, I like red, but take your pick</li>
            <li>Chicken Thighs, boneless and skinless preferably</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix more garlic than you'd think you'd need and a bunch of ginger together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Season this mixture with garam masala, tumeric, cumin, ground chili peppers, salt and black pepper. You can kind of go wild at this stage, add in smoked paprika or freshly toast and grind your spices, make it your own dish. </li>
            <li>Trim and cut your chicken into pieces that are on the large end of &#8220; bite sized &#8221;.</li>
            <li>Add about half of the garlic/ginger paste to a reasonable amount of yogurt, your goal is to get enough of this mixture to coat all of your chicken, use your best judgment here. Save the other half, you will need it later.</li>
            <li>Marinate the chicken in the yogurt mixture for a while, at least an hour on the counter, but I prefer overnight in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Get large, heavy skillet heated up over medium heat and turn off your smoke detector, or fire up your grill.</li>
            <li>Melt a bit of ghee, or add oil of your choosing, if using a pan at least.</li>
            <li>Add pieces of chicken, leaving room between them. You are aiming to get a bit of char on them, but not blacken them completely. A few burned bits won't hurt anything though. Flip as needed, and work in batches so you don't crowd the pan. If the fond in your pan gets too burned, scrape it out between batches. Add ghee/oil as needed.</li>
            <li>Once you are done with your chicken, if you have some nice fond in the bottom you can deglaze with a can of crushed tomatoes to keep that amazing flavor. If it is burned, just move on, the dish will be fine.</li>
            <li>Get a bigger pot than you need, if you are only cooking a small batch and you used a big enough pan for the chicken you might try that, but it never works well for me. Get it heating on medium/low.</li>
            <li>Add some ghee and chopped onion to the pot, cook until the onions are translucent. Honestly, cook them as long as you like, it comes out great with caramelized onions or entirely skipping this step and just adding them in on the next step.</li>
            <li>Add tomato paste and cook it down until it becomes a deep reddish brown.</li>
            <li>Add the rest of your garlic/ginger mix and cook it for a few minutes, or as long as you like.</li>
            <li>Once you are happy throw in some crushed or diced tomatoes, it probably won't matter as long as they aren't whole.</li>
            <li>Add in some cardamom pods.</li>
            <li>Once this mixture reaches a simmer, add in the chicken and mix it together. Side note: if you want a super smooth sauce, blend and strain it before adding the chicken, but that is way too much work for me.</li>
            <li>Now is a good time to taste it, you will almost certainly need salt and pepper, but you might also want to bump up some of the other flavors. I generally end up adding a bit of garam masala and more chilis at this point.</li>
            <li>Once you get it seasoned to your liking you can either call it a day and serve over rice with naan, <strong>remember to turn your smoke detector back on</strong>. Or you can check out these last minute tweaks:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Adding in yogurt will make it creamier without taking away too much from the tanginess of the tomatoes</li>
            <li>You can add heavy cream to thicken the sauce up and smooth it out a bit. This will cut back on the perceived acidity and give a far richer sauce, but it can also mellow out some of the other flavors.</li>
            <li>You can also add in butter or ghee to make it richer without giving it the creaminess of the above options.</li>
            <li>Garnish with cilantro and/or appropriately spicy chili oil.</li>
        </ul>
